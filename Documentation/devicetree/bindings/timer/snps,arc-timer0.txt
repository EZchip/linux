Synopsys ARC Local Timer with Interrupt Capabilities
- Found on all ARC CPUs (ARC700/ARCHS)
- Mandatory clockevent provider

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "snps,arc-timer0"
- interrupts : single Interrupt going into parent intc
	       (16 for ARCHS cores, 3 for ARC700 cores)
- clocks     : phandle to the source clock

Optional properties:

- interrupt-parent : phandle to parent intc

Example:

	timer0: timer_clkevt {
		compatible = "snps,arc-timer0";
		interrupts = <3>;
		interrupt-parent = <&core_intc>;
		clocks = <&core_clk>;
	};
